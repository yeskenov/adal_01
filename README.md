I've worked on this React Native project back in 2018 with one of my friends. The project serves as a directory of restaurants and companies that serve the food permissible by Islamic regulations. We've launched the Android version in August of 2018 and had 100+ downloads. Later we've removed the application from the Play Store to release the new version of the application with more advanced architecture that will feature MongoDB database and Google Maps API. Here are some screenshots of the project:
